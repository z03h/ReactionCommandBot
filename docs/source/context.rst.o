ReactionContext Reference
=========================

There's a lot of weird crap that goes on here. A
:class:`ProxyBase <discord.ext.reactioncommands.reactionproxy>` is used if
anything cannot be resolved to the actual object. Ex: A ``ProxyMember`` may be
used instead of :class:`discord.Member` if there is no member cache.
