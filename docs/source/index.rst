   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

ext-reactions Docs
=============================================

Extension for discord.py that adds reaction commands.

Extremely `pepega <https://www.streamscheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/pepega.png>`_, but it works.
I think...

Should be 100% compatible with normal discord.py commands. Tried to make reaction
commands as similar as I could to base commands in discord.py.

Only stuff that's been modified is here, everything else is the same and you should
use :doc:`Discord.py Docs <dpy:index>` for anything that's not found here.

Install with pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/z03h/ext-reactions@master

    # or windows
    py -3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/z03h/ext-reactions@master
