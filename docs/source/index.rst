   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

ext-reactions Docs
=============================================

| Extension for discord.py that adds reaction commands.
| Extremely `pepega <https://www.streamscheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/pepega.png>`_, but it works. I think...

Should be 100% compatible with discord.py commands. Tried to make reaction
commands as similar as possible.

You should use :doc:`Discord.py Docs <dpy:index>` for anything that's not found here.
Only things that have been modified are here, everything else should be the same.
