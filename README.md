# Reaction Commands Extension
Extension to discord.py Bot that adds reaction based commands.


I'll finish this eventually and ~~document it somewhere maybe~~.

Example code

```python
import asyncio

import discord
from discord.ext import commands, reactioncommands

intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.members = True


bot = reactioncommands.ReactionBot(command_prefix='!',
                                   prefix_emoji='🤔',
                                   listening_emoji='👀',
                                   intents=intents)

@bot.reaction_command('🏓')
async def ping(ctx):
    await ctx.send('Pong!')

with open('definitely-not-my-token', 'r') as f:
    token = f.read()

bot.run(token)
```

Why would you use this?

You wouldn't, but you can use/subclass `ReactionBot` and it should behave
like a normal `ext.commands.Bot`.

~~You can make Bot commands without message intent, so it has that going for it~~
